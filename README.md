# Stackline Assessment

### Libraries used
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- Tanstack (For table)
- Recharts
- Redux toolkit/React redux

To run the application in local, clone the repository and run `npm i` from the terminal to install the dependencies and run `npm start` to run the app. 

### Notes
- I'm not sure which data was used to generate the two line graphs in the mock image, so I considered the cumulative `retailSales` and `wholesaleSales` (grouped by month) as the data for the line chart.
- I used the TanStack Table library because making styling changes and implementing features like sorting is easier with TanStack.
